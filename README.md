<h1 align="center">Rice Classification Project</h1>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

This project aims to classify different varieties of rice based on their 
morphological and textural features. The classification is implemented 
using the python programming language framework and libraries such as 
RandomForestClassifier,XGBClassifier,Support Vector Classifier(SVC), 
Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow.

<h3>Dataset</h3>
The dataset used in this project consists of five samples of rice classes 
with a total of 15,000 samples for each rice varieties, the features 
include area, perimeter, minor_axis, major_axis, eccentricity, solidity, 
conves_area, extent, aspect_ratio, roundness, compactness and class. 
The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets in the following ration 60:20:20.
